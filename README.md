## ALL HAIL EMAIL 

This is a breakdown of Brian's All Hail Email repo which is a roundup of the best email resources and links.

I have committed to this repository an email scaffold form created from scratch with the help of TeamTreehouse's HTML Design course. This is used as a foundation and will be changing as more knowledge is acquired.

Using the current scaffold form will work nicely across all browsers such as:

IE - Firefox - Chrome - Safari - Opera, etc.

Any templates in my repository use best practices and will work and appear nicely across all email clients such as: 

Outlook, Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc.

This can all be verified with helpful online utilities & services below so let's try our best to help prevent [Evil](http://brianlau.me/b/images/email_devil.png) Email!
