## BRIAN'S EMAIL MASTER repo


Roundup of all my resources and links at the bottom.

Put up an email scaffold form scratch - may change as fast as my tastes.

Using the current scaffold form will work nicely across all browsers such as:

IE - Firefox - Chrome - Safari - Opera, etc.

Any templates in my repository use best practices and will work and appear nicely across all email clients such as: Outlook, Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc.

This can all be verified with helpful online utilities & services below:
